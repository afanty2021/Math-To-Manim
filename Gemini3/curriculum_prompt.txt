Create a Manim animation script (using Manim Community Edition) that explains Class Imbalance & Sampling Techniques in Machine Learning.
The animation should be approximately 2 minutes long and include the following scenes:

1.  **The Imbalance Problem**:
    *   Show a 3D scatter plot with two classes: "Majority" (Blue spheres, 95%) and "Minority" (Red spheres, 5%).
    *   Show a decision boundary (plane) that ignores the Minority class to maximize accuracy (The "Accuracy Paradox").
    *   Explain that 95% accuracy is meaningless if we miss all the important cases (e.g., fraud, disease).

2.  **Undersampling (Random)**:
    *   Visualise the removal of Majority class points until the ratio is balanced (e.g., 50/50).
    *   Show the dataset shrinking.
    *   Pros: Faster training. Cons: Loss of information.

3.  **Oversampling (Random)**:
    *   Visualise the duplication of Minority class points.
    *   Show the Red spheres "popping" into existence on top of existing ones.
    *   Pros: No info loss. Cons: Overfitting (model memorizes duplicates).

4.  **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**:
    *   Zoom in on the Minority class points in 3D space.
    *   Draw lines between neighboring Red spheres (k-nearest neighbors).
    *   Animate the creation of *new* synthetic Red spheres along these lines.
    *   Explain this creates plausible new examples, not just duplicates.

5.  **Conclusion**:
    *   Summary of when to use which technique.
    *   Undersampling for massive datasets.
    *   SMOTE for most standard imbalance problems.

Use clear colors:
*   MAJORITY CLASS: Blue
*   MINORITY CLASS: Red
*   SYNTHETIC POINTS: Glowing Orange/Yellow

Ensure the code is complete, runnable, and uses `ThreeDScene` and `ThreeDAxes` as requested. Add voiceover text as comments.
